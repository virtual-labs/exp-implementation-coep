### Procedure 

 ####  Basic Knowledge
-  Answer all the questions and click on next level

 #### Configuration
- Select height of tank , Enter "Setpoint" valve and click on submit button 
- Select span of DPT and pressure transmitter /click the configuration button 

#### Simulation 
-  Click on water inlet valve (V1) to fill the tank 
- Observe the DPT reading 
- After that click on valve V3 and observe DPT reading, PC reading and action on valves V4,V5 and V6 
- LSL sensor turns red after water level reaches to low level 
- Click on V1 to fill tank again  
- Observe DPT, Pc readings and action on valves V4,V5 and V6
- Process is completed for one iteration. 

####  Configuration for second iteration 
- Select height of tank (select different height from first configuration for better understanding), Enter "Setpoint" valve and click on submit button 
- Select span of DPT and pressure transmitter . click the configuration button 

####  Simulation for  second iteration 
- Click on water inlet valve (V1) to fill the tank 
- Observe the DPT reading 
- After that click on valve V3 and observe DPT reading, PC reading and action on valves V4,V5 and V6 
-  LSL sensor turns red after water level reaches to low level 
-  Click on V1 to fill tank again  
- Observe DPT, Pc readings and action on valves V4,V5 and V6 
- Process is completed for both iterations. write down the observation of the plant in your note-book and click on "Result" button
